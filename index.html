      <h2 class='center'>Profile</h2>
      <p class='center'>I am a very outgoing enthusiastic person who is very easy to get a along with. I am confident and enjoy working as part of a team, but can also work independently following instructions. I am reliable and trustworthy and enjoy learning and would welcome the opportunity to learn a trade. I have a good sense of humour, and have gained life experience and aptitudes since leaving school in 2002, which would hold me in a good stead for any work position I held. I gain working relationships easy and feel I am an approachable person. Gaming has been a hobby since my early teens. This over the years has help me learn to build, maintain and service my own high-performance computers, as well as providing friends and family with technical support for personal laptops and computers. All of this has enabled me to start up my own business which I do in my spare time, fixing mobile phones, tablets and laptops. I have an in depth knowledge of the Windows operating system and have recently started to learn macOS to diagnose and repair faulty MacBook Pros.</p>

  <h2>Work History</h2>
    <h4>Inchcape Retail - Service Advisor<br>
        01/2022 - Present</h4>
    <p>Since joining the company, I quickly established working relationships with my team and feel like I settled in well. I became a trusted colleague to my manager who gave me extra responsibilities to assist him. My day to day duties involve serving customers, both face to face and on the phone. Some of my daily tasks involve checking customers cars in ensuring that any damage is documented, meaning I need a eye for detail to ensure nothing is missed. I  update customers throughout the day with how the work on the vehicle is going, let them know about any faults that have been found and any additional work that needs to be carried out. This then involves some upselling to secure the work for the company. I then hand the vehicle back to the customer once all the work has been completed and take payments whilst always giving them great customer service.</p>
    <h4>Tesco Mobile - Line Manager<br>
    05/2015 - 12/2021</h4>
    <p>As the team manager, my duties are to ensure the team and individuals are hitting sales and insurance targets. I achieve this by conducting periodic reviews to ensure that all individuals are getting the correct coaching to exceed customers’ expectations. These processes help me ensure that my team are happy within their job, and any ideas they might have for the business. As a team, we also have a responsibility to provide technical support to customers of all age ranges and diagnose any issues they are experiencing. With my previous skills in technology, I help train and provide information to my team, which helps them perform these technical duties. Alongside this, I have the responsibility of managing hours and dealing with any absence issues if they were to arise within our team.

I regularly liaised with the team during huddles and took on extra duties from my manager.<br><br>
  
I had also now been promoted into a Management Pool which means I am currently covering Customer Service Motor Teams whilst their existing manager is on annual leave or away from the office. This has increased my responsibilities within the office.
